# former

## What is it

A headless (React)[https://react.dev] form component. It allows you to 
specify form fields, which will then create child form controllers 
with separate states. All form controls will update in their own 
independent states allow the field to update just itself instead of all fields.

Being headless means that it does not create any form components itself and
works with any forms you already have.

## How to install

`npm install --save @rageix/former`
